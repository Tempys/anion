Anion is a fremework for dealing with binary encoded data, the idea of this framework taken from Preon framework, wich doing this staff awesome, but.. it is not supporting java 1.4
<br>Anion used to avoid ugly bitwise manipulations when you are need to parse/create binary stream(s)

Getting started:<br>
to use with gradle just add following lines into you build file
```
repositories {
     maven { url "https://github.com/shaddyx/maven_repository/raw/master/" }
}

dependencies {
  compile "ua.org.shaddy:anion:1.0.12-SNAPSHOT"
}```
